      <p>The expedition through immigration and customs was quick and efficient. Our passports proudly bear the official sticker stating we are in fact, in Japan.</p>

<p>Our first train ride was on the very impressive, Narita Express to Tokyo.  On our journey we were excited to see snow topped mountains and some names we recognised from home like Toyota, ToysRUs and Mazda.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014/12/2014-12-06-07-47-46-3.jpg" alt="Narita Express" /></p>

<p>We arrived at Tokyo Central station and soon got a sense of the size of the station after we walked for 20 minutes following well signed boards to find our connecting line!</p>

<p>After we emerged into the big world of Tokyo city we had a lesson of the day and that was, that there is more than one major bridge crossing the estuary section of Tokyo. Needless to say we crossed about 3 of them thinking they were the right one but with persistence we found our way.</p>

<p>Our first impression of Tokyo is that it is amazingly clean and very orderly. There is definitely a slow left lane and fast right lane in pedestrian traffic. The locals are very friendly, offering help when they see us with puzzled faces and one lady even offered Jennifer &amp; Kathy a pack of tissues to dry their hands as their was no paper towel left in a ladies restroom.</p>

<p>Our taste sensations for today included salmon which we all agreed was sensational. We also tried tempura onion and tempura potato, the lady showed us the actual vegetable which looked like a purple skinned sweet potato (Emo satsuymo) but the inside flesh was white - they were both oishii.</p>
