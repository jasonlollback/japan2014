      <p>Our first rainy day plan had to be enacted today which set us off to the port in Osaka to see the biggest aquarium in the world.</p>

<p>We spent the entire day here as we all love animals.</p>

<p>After walking through a big dome tank we found the adorable otters.

<p>The seals were entertaining and we enjoyed watching their feeding presentation.  All the trainers came out dressed like Santa&rsquo;s helpers. The seals performed great tricks, waving, turning, making a fan, sliding into the water and jumping out.

<p>The capybara were cute. They are the largest rodent, have webbed feet and two very large front teeth.  James and Jennifer learnt about these animals on the tv show called &ldquo;Scope&rdquo;. We went back to watch him get fed and saw him enjoy Pak Choy and carrots.<br />

<p>We liked watching the sea lions.

<p>The Dolphins are always a favourite, so clever and graceful. We went back to watch the feeding presentation and the Dolphins put on a great show.

<p>We watched the King Island penguins and we are always are bewildered how they fit such big fish into their beaks.  We always enjoy watching their waddle, they are very cute.</p>

<p>We watched the feeding in the shark tank. Many of the small fish (food) fell to the tank floor and it was fascinating to watch the stingray flap to make a wave and lift the fish enough to scoop them up in their mouths. They did a great job cleaning up the fish off the sea floor. In fact they probably got more fish than the Sharks.</p>

<p>The sloth was living up to his name, hanging about on a tree limb until a trainer with some food came his way.

<p>We were highly amused by the Hopper penguins.  There was one who appeared to be trying to escape down the drain. He stood in the drain when the cleaner took the grate off and he was trying to move the grate with his beak to put himself in there, instead of being in the pen. Another penguin then joined the crusade and we imagined the fish in the tank from Nemo trying to escape down the drain but similarly the penguins quest failed.</p>

<p>Outside the lights were beautiful. A huge whale was depicted in coloured lights.</p>
