      <p>The day has finally arrived, our bags are packed and we are excited to go on holidays to Japan. We imagine temples, snow, peace and Oishii foods are in our future.  Our family holiday is going to be great!</p>

<p>Our first leg of the journey is from Brisbane to Sydney, so Brisbane airport here we come. Upon arrival, we checked our luggage in for the entire journey and plane watched from the departure lounge until boarding.  The flight arriving from Sydney was late so we left Brisbane about an hour late.</p>

<p>The Captain said he was going to make slight alterations to the flight path to avoid the storm and keep us safe, we liked that idea. We enjoyed a snack on the plane, caramelised onion, biscuits and a chocolate and the flight was over before we knew it.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in Sydney we made our way to the seamless transfer station to hop on the bus to the International airport.  We made our way through Immigration and Customs very quickly.  As we were later than anticipated arriving from Brisbane we didn&rsquo;t have long to wait before we boarded the Qantas 747 for Narita airport in Tokyo.</p>

<p>We sat in four seats across the middle of the plane and James and Jennifer were excited about the prospect of getting to watch something on the television. Well that excitement increased tenfold when they were served meatballs and pasta, two fruits, muesli bar and apple juice.  Jason and Kathy were happy to be served a gourmet selection of coleslaw, hake with steamed vegetables, roast potatoes with a horseradish and lemon sauce, salted caramel chocolate mousse and tea. My goodness that was a lot of food!</p>

<p>Whilst all the food came there was time for some movies, James watched &ldquo;The Lego Movie&rdquo;, Jennifer watched some of &ldquo;Frozen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dolphin Tale 2&rdquo;, Jason watched the &ldquo;Expendables 3&rdquo; and Kathy watched &ldquo;Get On Up&rdquo; the James Brown story.  It was then declared time for sleep for the Lollback&rsquo;s. Sleep wasn&rsquo;t too bad considering we were on a plane but of course it wasn&rsquo;t fantastic either. Jennifer and Kathy woke at 3am and didn&rsquo;t really get back to sleep while the boys woke closer to food o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Breakfast was again very satisfying, Jennifer and James had scrambled eggs, bacon, baked beans an apple oat bar, two fruits and juice and the adults had soy glazed salmon, steamed spinach, sesame seeds and okowa rice with fruit, juice, muffin and tea.</p>

<p>We arrived safely at Narita airport Tokyo, Japan at 6am where it was 0 degrees celcius.</p>

<p>Hooray we are here, but wow <strong>it IS going to be cold!</strong> Nevertheless we are still excited!</p>
