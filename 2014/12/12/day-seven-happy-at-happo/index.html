      <p>When we woke up this morning it was snowing. Hooray!!  There is something extraordinarily peaceful about watching snow flakes fall, we the novice to snow, could do it for hours, second only to playing in the snow.</p>

<p>There are lots of snow resorts here in Hakuba. Today we thought we would visit Happo.  We caught the bus from the train station to the ski resort. We were told that Nakiyama would be a good place to go, so we bought a snow board and made our way over to there.</p>

<p>James and Jennifer had enormous fun sliding the slopes, forwards, backwards and sideways.</p>

<p>We think Jennifer has waited all her life to do a real snow angel. She&rsquo;s tried it in the Kindergarten sandpit, at the beach and now was her opportunity to do it for real in the snow.  Of course she loved it.</p>

<p>Of course not to be out done by his sister, James gave it a try too.</p>

<p>There was time for making a snowman. Jason created his fun masterpiece, decked out with natural features. Who says he&rsquo;s not creative?</p>

<p>Perhaps the snowman sneezed?, well something drastic happened and his head fell off!!!! Poor snowman!!</p>

<p>Kathy built a snow girl and named her Sally SnowGirl. It&rsquo;s our first attempt ever at building snow people and we are truly big kids at heart because it was great fun.</p>

<p>Whilst this was happening, James and Jennifer starting building an igloo. The igloo was to protect us from the cold and could be a haven for eating, hence a humble abode was in the making. Snow was carried, pulled and thrown (or perhaps that was just a snowball game in between), from all directions. All hands were called to task as stability was difficult at times, but a fine family masterpiece was eventually created.</p>

<p>We had to sneak further up the mountain to take a look at the gorgeous view. It is exquisite and we can&rsquo;t stop admiring it.</p>

<p>There was more snowboarding fun to be had on the journey down. Squeals of joy and giggles were had by all.</p>

<p>As we walked home it started snowing which certainly pleased us.  A great way to finish our wonderful snow experience.</p>
