      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was an early start for the Lollback&amp;rsquo;s and we were off to the Imperial Palace Gardens. When we arrived at the kikko-mon gate we went on a guided tour of the West gardens. We listened to an English recording and admired the amazing scenery and plants in the Imperial Palace Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://japan2014.lollback.com/images/2014/12/2014-12-09_11-03-11_DSC01380-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;maple tree&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tour we ate morning tea in the East gardens. Then we walked to Tokyo Station to book tickets for traveling to: Hakuba, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kyoto and back to Tokyo. Whilst we were there we activated our Japan Rail Passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the ticket booth and went shopping in Tokyo. James, Dad and I went to the Apple Store and Mum looked in department stores. the department store that Mum looked in had a staircase up the side of the building, so James, Dad and I HAD to walk up them. It was a nice view -except - it was blocked by the concrete wall that acted as a railing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the building we decided to take the elevator down to meet Mum. Then it was dinner - time we searched for a restaurant. We settled on an Italian style restaurant called Saizeriya. We ordered: 1 pizza, 2 pastas, some roast potatoes, carbonara with spinach    and chestnut sauce with ice cream and chocolate cake for dessert. Then we caught the train home and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
